# Hi I'm Liann!

You must be here to see if I am a good fit for a job. **Note that I do really like my job right now, and I am not looking for a new one...**

# tl;dr
* I am a software engineer
    * Specifically, right now, a Senior Software Engineer/Tech Lead at Google NYC working on Local Search.
* I have 8 years of experience working at both small-ish VC-funded tech companies and very big tech companies
* I live in New York
* You probably interface with some code that I've written nearly every day*

<small>*This is not as impressive as it sounds -- it is probably true of most engineers who have worked at the trifecta of Google, Facebook, and a SaaS company that sends lots of emails...</small>

# Skills I have

### Product engineering
  * I've been experimenting with user experiences for 8 years, so I have good opinions on what will work and what won't without needing to test anything
  * I can run the product side for small to medium sized features, which gives product managers the space to delve into long-term strategy and direction
  * I work as closely with product, designers, UX researchers, and data scientists as I do with other engineers
  
### Tech leadership
  * I like to set up structures that let individual engineers suceed (e.g. continuous testing, speedy code reviews, incremental onboarding practices)
  * It is important to me that the product we're building is the right product
  * I value giving accuate time estimates for how long things take, keeping cross-functional partners up to speed, and most importantly -- delivering the thing.

### Coding
  * I make time to write code, specifically, clean, well-tested code with minimal review comments
  * I am good at debugging weird, wonky things -- and knowing when it's not worth sinking any more time into debugging the weird, wonky thing, no matter how interesting it is

# Non-negotiables
* A physical office in NYC with some semblance of in-office culture
* At least one woman or underrepresented minority either in my management chain or at my level
  * Fun fact: *the vast majority of people in my management chain or at my level right now at Google are either women or underrepresented in tech!*
* Smart, respectful coworkers

# Important things
* Having a sponsor who is also a woman and/or underrepresented person in tech
* Opportunities to sponsor women and/or underrepresented people in tech

# Less important things
* Free, healthy food
* Natural light at my work desk
* Reasonable amounts of PTO because I like going on hiking and climbing trips

# Roles I'm interested in:
* Engineering management and/or staff+ jobs at companies where Engineering/Product/UX compose at least ~25% of the total workforce
* Being the first tech/product hire at a small company
* ???
