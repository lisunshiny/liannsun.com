# I am
an experienced product-focused software engineer and career tech lead.

You must be here to see if I am a good fit for a job. **Note that I do really like my job right now, and I am not looking for a new one...**

## tl;dr
* I am a software engineer and (usually) a tech lead
* I have 8 years of experience working at both small-ish VC-funded tech companies and very big tech companies
* I live in New York

## Skills I have

### Product engineering
  * I've been experimenting with large-scale tech products for 8 years, so I have good opinions on what will work and what won't without needing to test anything
  * I can PM small to medium sized features, which gives actual product managers more time to delve into long-term strategy and direction
  * I work with designers, UX researchers, product managers, and data scientists as closely I do with other engineers
  
### Tech leadership
  * I like to set up structures that let individual engineers suceed (e.g. continuous testing, speedy code reviews, incremental onboarding practices)
  * It is important to me that the product we're building adheres to modern software engineering quality standards
  * I value giving accuate time estimates for how long things take, keeping cross-functional partners up to speed, and most importantly -- delivering the thing.

### Coding
  * I make time to write code, specifically, clean, well-tested code with minimal review comments
  * I am good at debugging weird, wonky things -- and knowing when it's not worth sinking any more time into debugging the weird, wonky thing, no matter how interesting it is

# What I'm interested in
* Staff+ engineering manager or TL roles at medium to large tech companies
* Being the first tech hire at a small company
* ???

## What I'm looking for

### P0
* A physical office in NYC with some semblance of in-office culture
* Smart, respectful coworkers
* At least one women and/or other underrepresented community represented both in my engineering management chain *and* my level, or a very very good explalation for why this isn't possible
  * Fun fact: *My team at Google passes this test with flying colors!*

### P1
* Free, healthy food
* Natural light at my work desk
* Reasonable amounts of PTO
