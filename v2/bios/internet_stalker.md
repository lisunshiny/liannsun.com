# Hi I'm Liann!

You must be here (from... Hinge maybe?) to see if I am a cool person to go on a date with (spoiler: yes).

### Basics
* My pronouns are she/her
* My name is pronounced like "lee" + "anne"
* I am a nerdy person with minimal internet presence based in NYC. 
  * If you are looking for a social media influencer based in Canada with the same name, you are in the wrong spot!! 

### You should know
* I don't take myself very seriously, if you haven't noticed
* I like meeting people IRL (and if you mention this site I'll buy you a drink)
* I don't mind that you like to learn more about people before you meet them, but I won't know anything about you becuase I haven't looked you up! So please excuse my basic questions about your life.


### My hobbies
* Climbing
* Running
* Biking
* Hiking and long-distance backpacking
* Yoga
* Traveling
* Making lists

### Things I like talking about
* Who you are and what you care about!
* Who I am and what I care about!
* Cats, the most perfect little demons
